Description: The clustered competing risks regression model assesses the marginal effects of covariates
    on the respective cumulative incidence functions, while accommodating the correlation induced due to 
    clustering. An implementation of the 'forward-backward scan' algorithm for large clustered competing 
    risks datasets is provided.
